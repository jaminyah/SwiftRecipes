#Swift Recipes

1. Command Line Threading - Linux
```bash
$ mkdir CLThread
$ cd CLThread
$ swift package init --type executable
```
In the code listing, the contents of the print statement will not appear on the screen if the 
main thread does not wait until the background thread has finished executing. Since the background thread does not block the main thread, 
control is returned immediately to the main thread. Without the sleep delay, the main thread has
no further task to perform and so the program exits before the background thread completes the for-in loop. 
```swift
import Foundation

let bkgThread = Thread {
    for i in 0...100 {
        print("loop: \(i)")
    }
}
bkgThread.start()

// The main thread sleeps for 2 second 
// allowing time for the for-in loop to execute.
Thread.sleep(forTimeInterval: 2)
```
